# arduino-udp-stepper-motor-board
An Arduino based UDP stepper motor board designed using Fritzing. 

Atmega328 as Arduino replacement, A4988 Stepper motor driver and ENC28j60 Ethernet controller are the core components of this UDP stepper motor board helps to run stepper motors with just a few lines of code.

As UDP is a really fast communication protocol, so you're able to control stepper motors in rousingly fast speeds. And this in just a few lines of python code.
